# Programming Subject – University Coursework

This repository is used for my university programming subject. It contains all coursework-related materials, including coding exercises, weekly blog posts, and other programming activities assigned throughout the semester.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress and to submit and track weekly tasks as required for the course.
